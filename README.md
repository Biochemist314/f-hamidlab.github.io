# The Hamid Lab Website

## New member induction

Your goal is to add your profile onto the 
[Team page](https://f-hamidlab.github.io/team/) of our
[lab website](https://f-hamidlab.github.io). 
You would need:

1) A profile picture (800px by 800px preferably) to
be placed in the image folder
2) To complete your own profile card and add it 
to the _team folder
3) Submit a pull request

You pass the induction only when your profile is 
successfully rendered on our Team page. Good luck!
