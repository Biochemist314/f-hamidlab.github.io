# The Hamid Lab Website

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and was forked from Barry Clark's [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). The original header was revamped to make way for a simpler site logo and for implementation of a responsive menu bar. Ideas for the new menu bar was adapted from [@mutedblues](https://codepen.io/mutedblues/pen/MmPNPG).
