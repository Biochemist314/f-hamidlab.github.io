Welcoming the year of the dragon.
<br><br>

We spent our lab's first Lunar New Year celebration with
chinese calligraphy writing and Prosperity Toss (aka Yu Sheng). Everyone
had a go at writing well wishes using authentic calligraphy
brushes and ink. The wishes written revolve around Bountiful Fortune,
Good Health and Achieving Dreams. Yu sheng (余升) means an increase in
abundance and it is a practice where friends and families toss up the
ingredients of the yu sheng salad using a pair of chopsticks. The goal
is to toss up the ingredients as high as you can while shouting auspicious
phrases. The higher you toss it, the higher the chance of the wish being
granted.
