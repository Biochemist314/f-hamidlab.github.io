Our lab's second Christmas Party together!
<br><br>

The theme for this year is Mythology~
Our team was split into 2 groups, the Santa group
and the Mythbusters group (check out the facial hair). 
I mean, Santa is a Myth and a Myth needs to be busted right?

We had great time planning the scripts and designing the rocket-powered
sleigh (whut?). The performance was Oscar-worthy and we had lots of fun!
Looking forward to Christmas Party 2025!
