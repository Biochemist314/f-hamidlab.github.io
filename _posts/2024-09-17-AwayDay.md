A 2-day getaway to Cambridge

<br>

The annual Scientific Retreat and the Away Day of the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology brought us over to Cambridge.
What an incredible experience it was, to say the least!

<br>

The retreat started off with a number of eye opening posters and talks form PhD students and postdocs on the ongoing research as well as the importance of enabling research within the centre.
This included a talk from [Prof. Madeline Lancaster](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/lancaster/) on the journey to her renowned work on organoid development.

<br>

Huge thanks for Jane and Karla, our image analyst and the bioinformatician, for the wonderful poster presented on the services provided by us!

<br>

The two day retreat came to an end with an eventful games evening, a barbecue night and memories to cherish for years.
