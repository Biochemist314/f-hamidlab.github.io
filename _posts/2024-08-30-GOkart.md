We gathered for a friendly race on the tracks.
<br><br>
**Venue**: [Revolution Karting](https://revolutionkarting.com/)
<br>
**Number of racers**: 8

<br>

The weather was sunny but chilly. The tracks were damp, perfect for
drifting. For most of us, it was our first time driving a go-kart.
All of us had a great time.

<br>

Karla had the fastest lap of the day, despite her go-kart stalling midway.
Mini Fursham(s) were too small to drive and enjoyed the sounds of electric
go-karts by the stands.
Sunny started out at 5 mph but ramped up to 50mph during her last race.
Tek and TJ overcame the sharp turns with no accidents.
Jane and Hiruni are now officially drivers.
All of us suffered sore arms and wrists.
