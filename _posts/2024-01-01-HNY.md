Wishing everyone a wonderful and productive year ahead!
<br><br>

We spent our lab's first Christmas/New Year together playing
games and eating home cooked food. Each of us prepared a special
dish; we had chicken rice, enchiladas, marinated chicken drumsticks,
tofu, pineapple and sausage skewers, and longan cocktail. We played
a kid's card game (Donkey), video games on Nintendo Switch and 
not forgetting, Mah Jong!
