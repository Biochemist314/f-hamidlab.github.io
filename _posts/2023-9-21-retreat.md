We shared our work to fellow scientists from the
Centre for Developmental Neurobiology.
<br><br>

The venue: Senate House, University of London.

It was our Centre's 1st Scientific Retreat and we had the pleasure
of presenting our work to students and staff members from 
the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology. Jane presented a poster
on the results generated by our prototype Python module that quantifies
cellular features of neurons captured by two-photon calcium imaging. 
Fursham gave a talk that introduces the research interests of the lab
and the exciting science we plan to carry out in the near future.
