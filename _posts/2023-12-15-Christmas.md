Hamid lab's first Centre Christmas party 
and it was a blast! 
<br><br>

The theme for this year's Christmas party is 
SPACE 🌌! We dressed up as space-themed chocolates 
because... chocolates! We chose Mars, Galaxy 
and Milky way as our costumes. We spent half 
a day making our costumes together using simple, 
recyclable materials we can find. Check out
the rear side of our costumes!

For our performance, the talented Jane played
the ukelele to David Bowie's Space Oddity 
(perfect for the theme right!). Fursham was the
lead singer and Karla played the drums. The
performance went as planned and everyone sang along the chorus with us 🎤.

This is our lab's first Christmas celebration together at the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology. 
We hope Jane and Karla enjoyed themselves and got a feel of our Centre's festivities. 
Here's to many more Christmas celebrations ahead 🍾
