We officially moved into our new lab/office at room 4.2, New Hunt's House!

<br><br>

This move has been a long time coming and it went smoothly. There isn't much 
equipment to bring over, but transferring our workstation was nerve-wrecking.
Apart from insufficient ethernet ports, we managed to get the workstation 
back up and running within 2 hours. The best thing is, we now have our own 
little lunch space and can accommodate up to 3 more staff/students. We
celebrated with a simple office-warming party with tropical fruit juice, grapefruit tea,
tiramisu and games!
