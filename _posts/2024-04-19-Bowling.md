What better way to welcome the spring season than to engage in a friendly game of bowling ðŸŽ³

<br><br>

The lab is growing steadily and is at its 
highest capacity right now. We are in a 
sweet spot with the addition of Sunny, 
our LiDO PhD rotation student, and the 
soon-to-finish research project students 
Alaric and TJ. We felt that it's the perfect
opportunity to spend quality time together 
outside of the lab and decided on a friendly 
game of bowling. 

The top scorers of the game were Fursham and 
Jane with 90 measly points each. Jane attributed 
her performance to the many years of experience 
in playing bowling on the Nintendo Wii and
Fursham got lucky.

For afters, we had a lovely snack/dinner at an
authentic Hong Kong Cafe called HOKO. They
served a tasty Classic French Toast that 
made all skipped proper dinner. 

It was a memorable evening and we all look forward 
to more gathering and events in the future
