<h1>Lab values and culture</h1> 

<p>Purpose (/ˈpəːpəs/): a person's sense of resolve or determination.</p>
<br>
<p>Like any other career, I believe that a scientist need to establish a strong sense of purpose in anything he/she does. 
Our purpose drives us to wake up in the morning to be in the lab. Our purpose keeps us grounded when facing problems
and hurdles. Everyone's purpose is different, so do take time to reflect and be true to yourself when finding your purpose.</p>
<br>
<p>Programming is a core skill that everyone in the lab should be able to do. I believe that we have to be efficient and 
precise in our work, and constantly find better ways to perform our tasks. We put emphasis on writing codes that are robust
and reproducible, and strive to be transparent with our work. A quote that I live by: <strong>"If you need to do/write something more than twice, you have to automate it."</strong></p>
<br>
<p>I strongly concur that our lab members are our greatest asset. Everyone, regardless of race, language or religion, is uniquely talented
and can provide specific skill sets to the lab. I strive to create a lab environment and culture where we can get to realise each other's
talent and learn from one another. Whenever we work hard, we will reward ourselves by playing hard.</p>
